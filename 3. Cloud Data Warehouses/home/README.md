# Data warehouse project

## Overview:
This project is used to collect, extract, tranform and load data related to music and user's event to analyze song play of user.
    
The data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.
    
We will build an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights into what songs their users are listening to.
    
## About dataset:
### Song data: s3://udacity-dend/song_data: 
Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset:
    - song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
    - song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like:
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}

### Log data: s3://udacity-dend/log_data:
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.
The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset:
    - log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
    - log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like:

### Log data json path: s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json

## About staging and storage data:
### We have 2 tables (staging_events, staging_songs) that pull data from S3 to Redshift before create the data warehouse.

### About Schema for Song Play Analysis:
    - Fact Table:
        + songplays - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
            (songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent).
            
    - Dimension Tables:
        + users - users in the app
            (user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level)
            
        + songs - songs in music database
            (song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration)
            
        + artists - artists in music database
            (artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude)
            
        + time - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
            (start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday)

## Project Template:
    - create_tables.py drops and creates your tables. Run this file to reset your tables before each time you run your ETL scripts.
    
    - etl.py is where load data from S3 into staging tables on Redshift and then process that data into your analytics tables on Redshift.
    
    - sql_queries.py contains all sql queries, and is imported into the last two files above
    
    - README.md provides informantion about project.

## Quick start:
### To access AWS, we need to do in AWS the following:
Create IAM role, get ARN and add to dwh.cfg file.
Create Security Groups on EC2, Cluster subnet group on Redshift -> Create Redshift cluster and add the information to dwh.cfg file.

### Install python3 environment, configparser and psycopg2 to run .py file

### Run command line:
python create_tables.py : Drops all the tables if exist then creates all needed tables.

python etl.py: 

### Go to AWS Redshift to check tables and data of them, example queries to check data:

SELECT top 100 * FROM staging_songs;
SELECT top 100 * FROM staging_events;
SELECT top 100 * FROM songplays;
SELECT top 100 * FROM users;
SELECT top 100 * FROM songs;
SELECT top 100 * FROM artists;
SELECT top 100 * FROM time;
