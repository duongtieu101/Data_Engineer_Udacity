# Data warehouse project

## Overview:
This project is used to collect, extract, tranform and load data related to music and user's event to analyze song play of user.
    
The data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.
    
We will build an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, processes and transforms them using Spark into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights into what songs their users are listening to.
    
## About dataset:
### Song data: s3://udacity-dend/song_data: 
Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset:
    - song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
    - song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like:
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}

### Log data: s3://udacity-dend/log_data:
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.
The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset:
    - log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
    - log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like:

## About Schema for Song Play Analysis:
    - Fact Table:
        + songplays - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
            (songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent).
            
    - Dimension Tables:
        + users - users in the app
            (user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level)
            
        + songs - songs in music database
            (song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration)
            
        + artists - artists in music database
            (artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude)
            
        + time - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
            (start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday)

## Project Template:
    - dl.cfg: contains your AWS credentials: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY.
    
    - etl.py reads data from S3, processes that data using Spark, and writes them back to this workspace.
        
    - README.md provides informantion about project.

## Quick start:
### To access AWS, we need to do in AWS the following:
Create IAM user, get AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, add to dl.cfg file.

### Install python3 environment, configparser and pyspark to run .py file

### Run command line:
python etl.py: create_spark_session, process_song_data and process_log_data.
